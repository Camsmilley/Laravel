                A guided hiking tour is the perfect way to experience a hike. You can let your guide handle the 
                harder aspects of the hike, and you can just enjoy all the beauty that the hike has to offer. 
                I offer customized, private guiding hiking tours and trips to small groups.

                Not only are these experiences enjoyable to have, but theyâ€™re good for you, too.
                Hiking is proven to have many health benefits, ranging from physical exercise you get when out on the trail, 
                to emotional or mental relief that comes from being in nature.
